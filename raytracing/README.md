This is a raytracing project. It follows the great [Raycasting From Scratch](https://github.com/nikolausmayer/raytracing-from-scratch) lesson by Nikolaus Mayer.

The plan is to use this project in order to get familiar with C++ by writing my own implementation before looking at the source code from the course. 
It would also be interesting to add my own features after finishing the course.
