# TinyRaytracer

This is a basic raytracer. 

It is heavily inspired from the great [Raycasting From Scratch](https://github.com/nikolausmayer/raytracing-from-scratch) lesson by Nikolaus Mayer.

The plan is to use this project in order to get familiar with C++ by writing my own implementation, using the theoretical explanations from the slides.
It will be interesting to add my own features aswell.

Next steps:

- Add UV mapping in order to use textures
- Improve positioning
- Export to other file formats

Some (fun) ideas:

- Implement atmospheric diffusion.
- Add clouds
